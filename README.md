# What Is (VS Code Extension)

At a VS Code Hackathon, I created an extension called What Is that helps beginner programmers become familiar with certain project files that may seem daunting at first. As a programmer, I always like to understand how everything works and what everything means. That's why I found it hard to jump right in to a project when there was so much starter code and auto-generated files that I didn't understand. This extension was created so that others can learn briefly about these files and fell more comfortable starting a new project.

## How it Works

The file options currently supported are the following:
* package.json 
* package-lock.json
* README.md
* .gitignore
* robots.txt

When one of these files appears in your project, you will have the option to learn more about the file by right-clicking on it and selecting the feature "What Is". A brief description of the file will then be shown in a message.
